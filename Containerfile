# ⚠ THE TEAM IMAGE PAIR, PINNED BY DATED TAG AND DIGEST. macula-ci-otp builds
# (OTP 28.4.3 on an OpenSSL with ML-DSA, rebar3, Rust, cmake); the release
# runs on macula-pq-runtime, the same Debian trixie, so its ERTS and NIFs match
# the libc they run on. lint.yml pins the same build image, and the service
# tests guard all three pins and the release the RUN step below insists on.
