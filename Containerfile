# mcl-turn-credentials
#
# Mints short-lived TURN credentials over the mesh, keeping the master secret out of client apps
#
# NO DATA VOLUME AS GENERATED. The scaffold writes nothing, and a named volume
# for data that does not exist is a promise the image cannot keep. Add one
# together with the code that writes it, and declare it here and in the compose
# file at the same time.

# ⚠ THE RUNTIME IS PINNED IN TWO PLACES AND THEY MUST AGREE: here and `lint.yml'
# beside it. A generated service that builds on one release and tests on another
# only ever proves "the tests pass on the CI release".
#
# This template said 27 from the beginning and nothing revisited it, so every
# service scaffolded from it inherited 27 while development machines moved on.
# In a sibling service that cost three commits of red CI on a crash that does not
# occur on the development release at all, and because `build-push.yml' is a
# separate workflow the image shipped to the fleet regardless.
# ⚠ PINNED BY TAG AND DIGEST. `erlang:28-alpine' floats, and when Docker Hub
# moved it on 2026-09-22 mcl-echo's next deploy shipped OTP 28.5 while lint
# tested something else. 28.4.3 is the team standard; the digest is the
# multi-arch index, so a re-pushed tag cannot change what builds. hexpm's
# image, because Docker's own `erlang' publishes no 28.4.3; Alpine 3.22.6, the
# same release as the runtime stage below, whose OpenSSL 3.5 carries ML-DSA.
# Move both on purpose, never by drift.
