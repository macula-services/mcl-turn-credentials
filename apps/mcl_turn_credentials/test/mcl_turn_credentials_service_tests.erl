%% @doc The service contract, asserted locally.
%%
%% mcl_om resolves its six callbacks BY NAME at startup, on a live node, so a
%% service that forgets one dies with `undef' where nobody is watching. The
%% primary defence is the `-behaviour(mcl_om_service)' attribute on the
%% service module, which turns a missing callback into a compile error under
%% warnings_as_errors.
%%
%% What this suite adds is everything the compiler cannot see: that the attribute
%% has not been quietly dropped, that the values inside those callbacks are the
%% shapes mcl_om will destructure, and that the names and version this service
%% reports are the ones it actually has. Nothing local boots mcl_om, so
%% asserting the shape by hand is the closest available thing to a rehearsal.

%% THREE COMMITS AND AN IMAGE THAT SHIPPED ANYWAY.

%% Its `Containerfile' said 27 while development ran on 28. So `rebar3 eunit'
%% passing locally meant "passing on 28" and nothing more, CI failed on a crash
%% that does not occur on 28 at all, and because the image build is a separate
%% workflow the image went to the fleet regardless.
%%
%% The release is pinned in TWO files, and the version actually running is a
%% third thing that agrees with neither by default. **A comment in each file
%% saying they must match is not a mechanism**, and both files carried one.
%%
%% ⚠⚠ IT FAILS RATHER THAN WARNS WHEN YOUR VM DIFFERS, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE.
%% Developing on a release you do not ship makes a green suite mean less than it
%% appears to. If you want to work on another release, move both pins and find
%% out what breaks, which is the whole point of having them.
%%
%% ⚠ TO THE PATCH, AND NOTHING FLOATS. This compared majors only, so when Docker
%% Hub moved the floating `erlang:28-alpine' on 2026-09-22 a service generated
%% from this template shipped OTP 28.5 and its guard stayed green. It compares
